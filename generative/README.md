# Generative Guides — Master Index

This index lists the top-level categories for generative topics and links to their category indexes. Each category and each topic provides a README.md that serves as an index and navigator.

Categories
- Frontend — ./frontend/README.md
- Backend — ./backend/README.md
- Data — ./data/README.md
- Architecture — ./architecture/README.md
- Platform — ./platform/README.md

See also: RULES.md — Generative Topic Taxonomy and Component Topic Indexing Policy. Note: Platform guides now live under ./platform/ (e.g., ci-cd, observability, secrets-config).
