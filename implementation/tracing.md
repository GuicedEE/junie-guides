# Tracing Implementation

* Local logs human-readable; cloud logs structured for trace platforms.
* Distributed tracing via OpenTelemetry.
* Auto-generated span attributes; errors linked to source spans.
* Trace hierarchy maps module-to-module relationships.
* Cloud Trace integration enabled by Terraform and Vert.x OpenTelemetry exporters.
