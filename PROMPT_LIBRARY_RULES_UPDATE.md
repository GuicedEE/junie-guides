# üß∞ Starter Prompt ‚Äî Library Rules Update (Framework/Component Libraries)

Use this prompt when you maintain a library (e.g., JWebMP, EntityAssist, WebAwesome) and need to update or (re)create its rules, indexes, and guides to align with the RulesRepository. This drives a forward-only, modular documentation model and ensures host projects can navigate component/topic rules easily.

Supported: JetBrains AI (Junie), GitHub Copilot Chat, Cursor, ChatGPT, Claude.

## 0) Provide Inputs
Fill before running.

- Library name: <LIBRARY_NAME>
- Current/new version: <VERSION>
- Repository URL / path: <REPO_URL_OR_PATH>
- Short description: <ONE_LINE_DESCRIPTION>
- Type: [ ] UI component library  [ ] Data/ORM  [ ] Service/Framework  [ ] Other: <OTHER>
- Primary language(s): <LANGUAGES>
- Component/topic areas (list): <TOPICS>
- AI engine used: [ ] JetBrains Junie  [ ] GitHub Copilot  [ ] Cursor  [ ] ChatGPT  [ ] Claude
- Release impact: [x] Forward-only (breaking changes allowed)  [ ] Backcompat required (only if explicitly demanded)

Policies (must honor):
- Follow RULES.md sections: 4 (Behavioral), 5 (Technical), Document Modularity Policy, 6 (Forward-Only Change Policy).
- For component-driven topics, provide a parent README index that links to each component .rules.md or subsection anchors.

---

## 1) Self‚ÄëConfigure the AI Engine
- Pin ./RULES.md anchors (sections above). Operate in forward-only mode.
- If Copilot/Cursor, create a workspace note or .cursor/rules.md summarizing constraints.

---

## 2) Library Documentation Tasks
Perform as a single, forward-only change set. The exact target paths depend on your library repo structure (e.g., docs/, guides/, or packages/<lib>/docs/). Do NOT put library-specific docs inside the RulesRepository submodule directory.

1. Topic index (parent README)
   - Create or update a topic index README for this library‚Äôs rules directory.
   - For UI libraries (e.g., WebAwesome):
     - Index each component with links to ./<component>.rules.md
     - If a component is documented as a subsection, add direct anchors (e.g., input.rules.md#number-input)
   - For non-UI libraries (e.g., EntityAssist):
     - Index modular topics (e.g., Entities, Repositories, Transactions, Testing, Anti-patterns)

2. Modularize content
   - Split monolithic docs into smaller modular files focused on a single topic/area.
   - Use kebab-case filenames; for components, use <component>.rules.md; for guides, prefer concise overviews.
   - Remove obsolete monoliths (no legacy anchors) and update all references per Forward-Only policy.

3. Rules templates (components)
   - For each component/topic, create a .rules.md with:
     - Overview and purpose
     - Usage patterns and minimal examples
     - Inputs/outputs/events (for UI)
     - Styling/theming (for UI) or configuration (for non-UI)
     - Accessibility (UI) or performance/constraints (non-UI)
     - See-also links (index, related rules)

4. Cross-links to enterprise topics
   - Link to relevant RulesRepository indexes in your README to aid host projects:
     - Web Components: rules/generative/frontend/webcomponents/README.md
     - Hibernate 7 Reactive: rules/generative/backend/hibernate/README.md
     - WebAwesome example index: rules/generative/frontend/webawesome/README.md

5. Versioning and release notes
   - If rules reorganization is breaking (likely under forward-only), prepare RELEASE_NOTES.md summarizing changes.
   - Update CHANGELOG.md and bump version appropriately.

6. README (library root) updates
   - Add ‚ÄúHow to use these rules‚Äù section pointing to your topic index and to the RulesRepository submodule usage.

---

## 3) Special Guidance by Library Type
- WebAwesome (UI components)
  - Ensure parent README index exists and includes components such as button.rules.md, input.rules.md (with #number-input anchor), etc.
  - For new components, add <name>.rules.md and update the index.
- JWebMP wrappers
  - Provide wrapper-specific rules where needed; link to underlying WebAwesome or Web Component contracts.
- EntityAssist / ORM-like libraries
  - Provide modular rules for entities, repositories, transactions, testing, threading, and anti-patterns.
- Service/Framework libraries
  - Provide modular rules for lifecycle, configuration, extension points, and integration examples.

---

## 4) Output Checklist
- [ ] Parent topic README index created/updated with full component/topic coverage
- [ ] Modular .md files created and linked; monoliths removed per Forward-Only policy
- [ ] Component .rules.md files created/updated with usage, patterns, and see-also links
- [ ] Cross-links to RulesRepository topic indexes included
- [ ] Release notes and version bump prepared (if applicable)
- [ ] Root README updated with navigation and usage instructions
- [ ] All links resolve

---

## 5) Guardrails
- No backwards compatibility stubs unless explicitly required; apply Forward-Only Change Policy fully.
- Keep library docs in the library repo (outside any RulesRepository submodule).
- Close loops: indexes ‚Üî rules files ‚Üî examples/implementations.
